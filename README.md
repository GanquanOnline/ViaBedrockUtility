Public fork of [EaseCation/ViaBedrockUtility](https://github.com/EaseCation/ViaBedrockUtility) (`master`, based on [`ebfbe10`](https://github.com/EaseCation/ViaBedrockUtility/commit/ebfbe1073306c0db5627f825cd6b987445eb5703)).
EaseCation/ViaBedrockUtility continues the [Oryxel/ViaBedrockUtility](https://github.com/Oryxel/ViaBedrockUtility) / ViaBedrock client-mod line.

This Fabric client mod restores Bedrock custom entities, skins, and animations for a Java Edition client that connects through ViaProxy_NetEase and ViaBedrock_NetEase.

| This repository | Pulled from | Branch | Upstream commit |

## Related repositories

| Repository | Role |
|---|---|
| ViaProxy_NetEase | Proxy the Java client connects to |
| ViaBedrock_NetEase | Translates Bedrock protocol and forwards custom payloads |
| **ViaBedrockUtility (this repo)** | Client-side rendering of those payloads |
| ViaVersion | Protocol library used inside the proxy |

Communication with ViaBedrock_NetEase:

| Channel | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `viabedrockutility:confirm` | C<->S | Handshake that the client mod is installed |
| `viabedrockutility:data` | S->C | Entity models, triggered animations, skins, capes, particles |

Changing payload layout requires a matching change in ViaBedrock_NetEase.

## Local changes

- Decode the previously unimplemented `ANIMATE` payload (UUID + animation name) so leftover bytes do not disconnect 1.21.11
- Play triggered animations on custom entities and Bedrock player skins
- Fall back to a bundled `enums.html` when the remote enum dump is unavailable
- CubeConverter UV map API (`getUvMap()`) plus extra actor-flag MoLang mappings

Active Minecraft version in this workspace: **1.21.11**.

# ViaBedrockUtility

A Fabric client mod that provides enhanced rendering capabilities for Minecraft Java Edition clients connecting to Bedrock servers via [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy) + [ViaBedrock](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ViaBedrock).

Inspired by [BedrockSkinUtility](https://github.com/Camotoy/BedrockSkinUtility), with some code reused from ViaBedrock.

[中文文档](README_zh.md)

## Features

- **Custom Entity Rendering** — Parses Bedrock geometry models, render controllers, and skeletal animations to render Bedrock custom entities on the Java Edition client
- **Custom Player Skins** — Supports Bedrock custom geometry skin models, capes, and animated skin overlays (blinking animations, etc.)
- **Bedrock Camera API** — Camera presets, position/rotation easing, fade in/out, camera shake
- **Animation LOD System** — Distance-based animation level-of-detail to optimize performance for distant entities

```

### Communication Channels

ViaBedrock handles Bedrock → Java protocol translation on the proxy side, while forwarding data that Java Edition cannot natively express (custom entity models, Bedrock skins, camera instructions, etc.) to the client mod via **Custom Payload** channels:

| Channel | Direction | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `viabedrockutility:data` | S→C | Entity model requests, animation data, skin/cape data |
| `becamera:data` | S→C | Camera presets, instructions, shake |

## Modules

### Custom Entity Rendering

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CustomEntityTicker` | Per-entity state machine managing MoLang scope, render controller evaluation, and animation condition computation |
| `CustomEntityRenderer` | Entity renderer managing Animator instances with multi-model blended animations |
| `CustomEntityModel` | Model wrapper supporting Bedrock bone visibility control |
| `McBoneModel` / `ModelPartBoneTarget` | Adapter layer wrapping Minecraft ModelPart as BedrockMotion IBoneModel/IBoneTarget |
| `GeometryUtil` | Bedrock geometry → Minecraft Model conversion, handling coordinate system differences and UV scaling |

**Rendering Pipeline**:
1. ViaBedrock sends `MODEL_REQUEST` payload (entity identifier, variant, skin ID, etc.)
2. `CustomEntityTicker` evaluates render controllers based on entity definition to determine current models/materials/textures
3. `CustomEntityRenderer` evaluates animation conditions each frame (MoLang expressions as blend weights) to drive skeletal animations
4. LOD system reduces animation update frequency for distant entities

### Custom Player Skins

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PayloadHandler` | Manages chunked skin data reception and assembly |
| `CustomPlayerRenderer` | Custom player renderer with texture override and animation overlay support |
| `AnimatedSkinOverlay` | Animated skin overlays supporting LINEAR (sequential frame) and BLINKING (automatic eye blink) playback modes |
| `PlayerAnimationManager` | Manages Bedrock animation overrides for players, handling axis clearing against vanilla animations |
| `PlayerSkinBuilder` | Cross-version compatible SkinTextures builder |

**Skin Data Flow**:
1. `SKIN_INFORMATION` — Skin dimensions, geometry JSON, chunk count
2. `SKIN_DATA` × N — Chunked RGBA texture data transmission
3. `CAPE` — Cape texture (optional)
4. `SKIN_ANIMATION_INFO` + `SKIN_ANIMATION_DATA` — Animated overlay layers (optional)

### Bedrock Camera API

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CameraPayloadHandler` | Processes camera instructions, shake, and presets |
| `CameraPresetsPayload` | Decodes server-registered camera presets (with parent inheritance) |
| `CameraInstructionPayload` | Camera set (position/rotation/easing), clear, fade in/out |
| `CameraShakePayload` | Positional/rotational camera shake |

Powered by the [BECamera](https://github.com/EaseCation/BECamera) library for camera state management and Mixin injection.

### Configuration

Configuration UI available via ModMenu or Sodium:

- **Animation LOD Presets**: HIGH_QUALITY (no LOD), BALANCED, PERFORMANCE, CUSTOM
- **Custom Tiers**: Control animation update frequency by distance threshold and frame interval

## Supported Minecraft Versions

Multi-version builds via [Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev/):

**1.21.5** · **1.21.6** · **1.21.7** · **1.21.8** · **1.21.9** · **1.21.10** · **1.21.11**

Active development version is **1.21.11**, with version-conditional compilation via `//? if >=1.21.9 {` comment syntax.

## Usage

### Required Components

1. **ViaProxy** — Proxy server through which the Java client connects to Bedrock servers
2. **ViaBedrock** — ViaProxy plugin that performs Java ↔ Bedrock protocol translation
3. **ViaBedrockUtility** — This mod, installed on the Fabric client

### Optional Components

- **BECamera** — For Bedrock Camera API support (already included as a dependency)
- **ModMenu** / **Cloth Config** — Graphical configuration UI
- **Sodium** — 1.21.11+ can integrate with Sodium's config panel

### Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and Fabric API
2. Place `viabedrockutility-mc<version>-1.0.0.jar` and `bedrockcameralib-mc<version>-1.2.0.jar` into the client `mods/` directory
3. Configure ViaProxy to connect to a Bedrock server
4. Launch the game and connect through the ViaProxy proxy

> **Note**: Choose the jar that **matches** your Minecraft client version. Do not use the root-level `viabedrockutility-1.0.0.jar` (that's the base version for 1.21.5). Version-specific jars are located under `versions/<MC version>/build/libs/`.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- JDK 21+
- Dependency projects published to mavenLocal (see below)

### Local Build

```bash
# 1. Build and publish CubeConverter
cd CubeConverter && ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

# 2. Build and publish BedrockMotion
cd BedrockMotion && ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

# 3. Build and publish BECamera
cd BECamera && ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

# 4. Build ViaBedrockUtility (all MC versions)
cd ViaBedrockUtility && ./gradlew chiseledBuild
```

Build artifacts are located at `versions/<MC version>/build/libs/viabedrockutility-mc<version>-1.0.0.jar`.

If using [ViaProxyWorkspace](https://github.com/EaseCation/ViaProxyWorkspace), you can build in one step:

```bash
cd ViaProxyWorkspace && ./gradlew buildViaBedrockUtility
```

### CI Build

GitHub Actions automatically builds all dependencies from source (bypassing JitPack cache issues):

```
CubeConverter → BedrockMotion → BECamera → ViaBedrockUtility
```

Each dependency is published to mavenLocal first, then `chiseledBuild` builds all MC versions.
